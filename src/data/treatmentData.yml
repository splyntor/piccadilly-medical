    Early referral to a specialist pain team has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with chronic pain in  multiple observational studies. Dr. Abdelghani and his team will ensure that your assessment is thorough and  treatment is started expeditiously avoiding unnecessary delays and helping you regain control of your life sooner. Early intervention for chronic pain can not only improve quality of life but also reduce the risk of further disability.

  title: Multimodal therapy
  content: >
    Chronic pain is a complex, multi-factorial problem that requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary team. Management often involves multiple modalities including pharmacological, physical and psychological therapy. Our team of experts are able to offer a holistic care plan and we will help you seek the advice of experts in other specialist areas such as rheumatology or orthopaedics to assist in your care.
