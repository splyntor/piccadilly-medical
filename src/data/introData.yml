    Interventional procedures that are designed to treat chronic pain have become increasingly more established in chronic pain management across the globe. Dr Abdelghani's experience of nationally recognised and guideline supported treatments has come through his specialised training in large NHS trusts in Manchester, and London where he became skilled in interventional pain procedures. He has subsequently developed a diversified portfolio of treatments and therapeutic procedures that further enhances his scope of chronic pain treatment. 
    Careful consideration of symptoms will determine the need for the multidisciplinary team input (if the support of psychology and physiotherapy are required).  This will ensure an enhanced choice of treatment or procedure to provide the best outcome for the patient.
