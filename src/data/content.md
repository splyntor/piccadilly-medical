“Welcome to Piccadilly Pain Management and thank you for taking the time to browse through our website.

We are based in Manchester and appointments can be arranged in London.  Piccadilly Pain Management is an ambitious service that provides a personalised patient experience.  

Here at Piccadilly Pain Management we believe in tailoring our range of treatment modalities to provide the best benefit to our patients. By doing so we are confident that we can provide you with the latest and best evidence based pain therapies and in turn improving quality of life. We believe the evolution of pain medicine as a subspecialty is reflected by the continuing relationship between health authorities, the Royal College of Anaesthetists and it's Faculty of Pain Medicine. 

Dr Mowafak Abdelghani had undertaken further specialist training at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, and was awarded Fellowship of the Faculty of Pain Medicine of the Royal College of Anaesthetists by examination.  He was later appointed as Consultant Anaesthetist and Clinical Lead in chronic pain at Central Manchester University Foundation Trust


## “Section: Why Piccadilly Medical

From initial assessment to treatment we aim to provide a multimodal approach that utilises the specialised skills of our multidisciplinary team comprised of a pain expert Psychiatrist and Physiotherapist, with support from Rheumatology & Orthopaedic consultants. 

Dr Abdelghani was instrumental in creating this structure within his local NHS pain service. 

His proactive involvement in pain medical research provides him with the ideal platform to identify and implement new treatments based on the latest and best international research. 
He has attended and participated in a multitude of international conferences and his opinion is highly regarded as evidenced by his contribution to chronic pain medical textbooks.

Interventional procedures that are designed to treat chronic pain have become increasingly more established in chronic pain management across the globe. Dr Abdelghani's experience of nationally recognised and guideline supported treatments has come through his specialised training in large NHS trusts in Manchester, and London where he became skilled in interventional pain procedures. He has subsequently developed a diversified portfolio of treatments and therapeutic procedures that further enhances his scope of chronic pain treatment. 

Careful consideration of symptoms will determine the need for the multidisciplinary team input (if the support of psychology and physiotherapy are required).  This will ensure an enhanced choice of treatment or procedure to provide the best outcome for the patient.
